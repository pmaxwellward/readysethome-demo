# Ready. Set. Home! - Demo
An HTML5 video app designed for the Amazon Fire TV platform. The original content is for patients only, so I have replaced all the videos with a trailer for the program. 

Built from this archived Amazon project: https://github.com/amzn/web-app-starter-kit-for-fire-tv 

Client: The Children's Home & Lemieux Family Center / Anthem Video
